ChangeLog for NameID Login Extension
====================================

Version 0.6.1 (trunk):
  * Add an extension icon.
  * Fix warning given by Mozilla add-on checker.

Version 0.5a (2014-07-01):
  * Whitelist nameid.bit and id.bit by default, too.
  * Switch to more flexible, event-based communication with the page.  This

    add-on using custom JS methods.

Version 0.4a (2014-02-16):
  * Use different, more robust internal mechanism to detect page loads.

Version 0.3a (2014-01-11):
  * Implement "signer" authentication.

Version 0.2a (2013-07-19):
  * Allow remembering trust/distrust decisions for sites.
  * https://nameid.org/ is white-listed by default.

Version 0.1.1a (2013-07-11):
  * Fix bug observing the login form page load multiple times.

Version 0.1a (2013-07-10):
  * First released alpha version.
  * Add-on working, but still in a very rough state.
