<h1>Contact Details</h1>

<p>If you want to contact me, just take a look at my own
<a href="?name=domob"><b>profile page</b></a>.  Encrypted emails
or <a href="https://bitmessage.org/">Bitmessage</a> are explicitly
welcome.  If you want to be sure about the keys, you can also
check out the data yourself in the Namecoin blockchain
with my identity
<a href="?name=domob"><code>id/domob</code></a>.</p>

<p><b>NameID</b> is a project I run purely for the sake of bringing
Namecoin identities to a wider usage, I don't have any
commercial interests in it.  I have an IT service business registered
in Austria nevertheless (not because of this project, though), and you
can contact me at:</p>
